# Poker Chip Launcher

This project is a mechanically actuated poker chip launcher designed and built using wood and rubber bands. 
The goal of the project was to create a simple, low-cost device capable of repeatedly launching standard poker chips while demonstrating fundamental engineering and design principles.
The launcher frame is constructed from wood to provide structural rigidity and ease of fabrication. 
Rubber bands are used as elastic energy storage elements, converting stored potential energy into kinetic energy to propel the poker chip upon release. 
The design emphasizes alignment, repeatability, and durability to ensure consistent launch performance over multiple trials.
Key engineering concepts applied in this project include mechanical energy storage and transfer, basic projectile motion, material selection, and iterative prototyping. 
Several design iterations were tested to improve launch distance, accuracy, and reliability by adjusting rubber band tension and launch geometry.
This project showcases hands-on fabrication skills, practical problem-solving, and the application of core mechanical engineering concepts using simple materials and tools.
